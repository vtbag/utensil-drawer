## !!! News !!!

`escapeViewTransitionName()` is a function that escapes your view transition names so you are not stuck with just `A-Za-Z0-9-_` characters. "😀"! It's a handy alternative to `CSS.escape()` for environments where that's not available.

For details see https://vtbag.dev/tools/utensil-drawer/

## What happened before?

> Stable: `declarative-names` allows you to assign view transition names to a set of HTML elements, offering a more reliable and controllable alternative to `view-transition-name: auto` that works cross-browser and also for cross-document navigation.

For details see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vtbag/utensil-drawer/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## What is it?

The Utensil Drawer holds reusable functions to help you build websites with view transitions. It is a bit sparse right now, but like the one in your kitchen, it is bound to fill up over time.
